Two styles of design in software development include evolutionary design and planned design. Planned design means that most of the design is done up front, and that the people programming are not the same as those designing. This can lead to problems, as often the requirements change and can be done more efficiently than originally planned when the actual programming occurs.

XP i.e. eXtreme Programming prefers evolutionary design and tries to solve its major problems. XP is based on the assumption that changes can be made with less impact on the process, if the correct enabling and exploitation practices are followed. These include refactoring, testing and continuous integration.

In XP one of the most emphasized values is simplicity and the principle of “You Aren’t Going to Need It”. Anything that isn’t required for the next version is left out regardless of how easy it is to implement. This makes later changes faster and cheaper and if the design is simpler, it is also easier to understand. Simplicity is also defined through for example testing and the fewest number of methods in a program.

A broad architecture can be taken advantage of when using XP and even diagrams can be a helpful tool when sharing and discussing information. It is also wise to use diagrams for on-going documentation at least for the easily changed documents.

Evolutionary design requires changes and thus designers should be able to void irreversibility in their planning and decisions. This leads to agile methods focusing on source code control and fast error correction in the process. Also, the customer can affect the product more easily when they see the changes in the system on a week-to-week basis.

Design directly affects the code base, and the more difficult it is to work in, the less likely that the right kind of design is happening. Thus in agile systems design requires for example keeping the code clean and simple and refactoring it so that bad decisions can be repaired later. Future changes and the usage of patterns can also make designing easier. Thus even though XP does not rely on the old way of designing, the same skills can be applied in different ways.
