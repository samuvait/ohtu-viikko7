### Summary of: http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/

The user stories of a conventional backlog do not explain well what the system does. This leads to Agile developers losing focus on the big picture of the system. A story map can be used as a tool to organize user stories into a more understandable shape.

The largest stories are put on the top of the story map. They contain many steps and may not be straight forward. These stories rarely fit into an iteration or a sprint so they break down into smaller “user tasks”. A user task is the steps for users to reach their goals. The basic structure of the map is to arrange smaller tasks under bigger tasks in a grid form. The stories can also be arranged so that the foremost tasks are put to the left and later tasks to the right.

The larger stories i.e. epics give context to the smaller tasks that are required to complete them. Thus, removing them can hinder the understanding of the whole product. The map can be used when explaining the product to someone on an appropriate detail level. The users can also notice whether the map contains everything relevant to the product. This increases the developers’ understanding of the product.

The largest stories on the map are like the “backbone” of the software which can be used to prioritize stories by necessity. The further from the backbone they are, the less necessary. The minimum viable product can be delivered only by having all the backbone, but the smaller things inside the items can be prioritized freely. The map can be displayed in order to remind everyone of the functionality of the software and the design order required for a reasonable product.
